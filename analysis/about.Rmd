`zinck` is a novel knockoff-based framework specifically designed for microbiome data analysis. Microbiome datasets are often high-dimensional, compositional, and zero-inflated, posing unique challenges for statistical analysis and interpretation. `zinck` addresses these challenges by employing a flexible generative model that effectively captures the zero-inflation and complex dependence structure characteristic of microbial communities. This approach allows for simultaneous variable selection and false discovery rate (FDR) control, making `zinck` particularly suited for taxonomic variable selection in microbiome studies.
